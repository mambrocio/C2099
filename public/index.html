        Arasaka isn't interested in compensating since they lost where you now stood, Militech could pay up but you're town would be down that list of reconstructing and recompensating. It could be years or even decades before they reach and even then you'd have to fight for the right amount of not only what you lost but those around you.
        After the bodies buried, some moved away to greener pastures or towards the ranchlands of the corporations who invaded the town. 

        The town’s governing body was unaccounted for either dead or have left, with some of the surviving people of the town. After the bodies were buried,

                    Neither Arasaka nor Militech wanted to responsibility of deaths, destruction, or any loss. Not a single Eddy to the town’s cause. After the bodies buried, some moved away to greener pastures or towards the ranchlands of the  corporations who invaded the town. 

The town’s governing body was unaccounted for either dead, left, or hauled off by one of the corporate powers as a grunt. It doesn’t matter. After giving some time to think about it, you sought out to rebuild but along the way reestablish of what it can be. 
Better. In Your Direction.

But let’s face it, You are not doing this alone, there are people and contacts you can reach out to. Some near, some far. But all see an opportunity to establish like you, with their own plans in mind.

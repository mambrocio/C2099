                    <h2>Welcome To Desire</h2>
                    <h3>From The Dust</h3>
        
                    <p>A town caught in the crossfires during the Fourth Corporate War. 
                        Bullets lodged into buildings and bodies of intended or unintended participants of the clash between the two mega corporations. After a short time when the fighting was done you went back to see the havoc left, in only a weekend’s worth time the place was wrecked as if they fought for two years there. 
                        Bullets scattered like seashells, more of the people who died there lived here, and roads shattered and scrawled. </p>
        
                        <p>
                            Neither Arasaka nor Militech wanted to responsibility of deaths, destruction, or any loss. Not a single Eddy to the town’s cause. After the bodies buried, some moved away to greener pastures or towards the ranchlands of the  corporations who invaded the town. 
        
        The town’s governing body was unaccounted for either dead, left, or hauled off by one of the corporate powers as a grunt. It doesn’t matter. After giving some time to think about it, you sought out to rebuild but along the way reestablish of what it can be. 
        Better. In Your Direction.
        
        But let’s face it, You are not doing this alone, there are people and contacts you can reach out to. Some near, some far. But all see an opportunity to establish like you, with their own plans in mind.
